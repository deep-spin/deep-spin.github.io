Title: News

* We presented a [tutorial on Latent Structure Models for NLP](https://deep-spin.github.io/tutorial/) at ACL 2019 in Florence.  
* André Martins is giving an invited talk at the [First EurNLP Summit](https://www.eurnlp.org) in London.  
* André Martins is giving invited talks at 3 Summer schools: [LxMLS 2019](http://lxmls.it.pt) in Lisbon, [AthNLP 2019](http://athnlp.iit.demokritos.gr) in Athens, and [MLRS 2019](https://www.mlrs.ai) in Bangkok. 
* Several deep spinners are organizing/serving as monitors in LxMLS 2019 (Lisbon Machine Learning School). See [here](http://lxmls.it.pt) for details!
* We have new papers accepted at AISTATS, NAACL, and ACL 2019.
* A joint team with Unbabel and IT won the WMT 2019 Shared Task on Quality Estimation! Check the results [here](http://www.statmt.org/wmt19/qe-results.html)!
* We received the **best system demo paper award** for OpenKiwi, a Pytorch-based software toolkit for translation quality estimation. Check the [repo](https://github.com/Unbabel/OpenKiwi) and the [demo paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08646) at ACL 2019!   
* Marcos Treviso is joining the [team](team.html) as a PhD student!
* We have a new EMNLP paper where we propose *SparseMAP* to build dynamic computation graphs via sparse latent structure (work done in collaboration with [Claire Cardie](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie)). Keep posted!
